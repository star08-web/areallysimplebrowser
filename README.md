a browser made with msedge webview2

# premise

this browser was done as an experiment, and it can't replace a modern browser like msedge, so ... don't use it as your primary browser

# the idea

when i discovered msedge webview2 i immediately used it in some apps, but then i thought ... if webview2 is based on edge theoretically it can be used as a browser ?

# #1 problem

the first problem came instantly, webview2 doesn't have an interface ... so it lacks features like: search bar, settings, password manager, history etc etc

luckily this is easily solved by creating an application and integrating webview into it

# #2 problem 

downloads, who has never downloaded something? unfortunately I was unable to integrate this function, so ... if you try to download something it will open another window and only then it will start downloading stuff

# #3 problem

protocols, https is not interpreted so to open a website you will also have to write its protocol so https:// + site name


# #4 problem

tabs, on webview they are not implemented (or I don't know how to use them) so .. get ready to have millions of windows open
